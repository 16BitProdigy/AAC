      <p class="profile">
        &emsp;&emsp;AIDEN ALLAN & CO was established when its principal
        partner pulled out from an active and brilliant law firm with a
        significant record of successes for more than a decade (ADENIYI,
        ASHAYE & CO).
      </p>
      <p>
        &emsp;&emsp;Upon a peaceful determination of the partnership agreement
        between the two managing partners of Adeniyi, Ashaye & Co, AIDEN ALLAN
        & CO was established in association with seasoned legal practitioners
        and exceptional administrative personnel. The Firm’s strong reputation
        stems largely from its recognized ability to identify and respond
        readily to significant changes in local and international Commercial
        Markets and the tested experience, competence and cohesion of its
        legal team.
      </p>

        of transactions amidst an increasingly intricate legislative and
        regulatory environment in Nigeria. Our team of dedicated legal
        practitioners have a unique understanding of all the complexities of
        the law, using our extensive familiarity with the relevant authorities
        and processes; we help deliver speedy resolution/solution for a
        multitude of legal procedures faced by our clients.
